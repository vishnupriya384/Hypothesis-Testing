# Hypothesis-Testing
 Do Women’s Soccer Matches See More Goals Than Men’s? As a passionate football enthusiast and a statistics student, I recently conducted a hypothesis testing study to analyze goal-scoring trends in men’s and women’s FIFA World Cup matches.
# Analysis
Using data from official FIFA World Cup matches since 2002, I set out to test:
📌 Null Hypothesis (H₀): The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's.
📌 Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than men's.

By applying the Mann-Whitney U test, I found a statistically significant difference (p-value ≈ 0.005) that led to rejecting the null hypothesis. This suggests that women’s FIFA World Cup matches tend to have more goals than men’s.
